							<p>A description of the steps our team took to architect and design the ReelHire service minimum viable product (MVP). Our design process was based on human-centered methodologies and we tried to make all of the architectural and development decisions based on our future users' goals, needs and motivations, alongside constraints our users might face while interacting with the service. This approach helped us to better prioritize functionality, identify and focus on the important parts of service's user experience and avoid inflating the project scope.</p>
							
							<hr>

							<p><b>Role:</b> UX/UI Designer & Developer</p>

							<hr>
							
							<h3>Designing the MVP - Desirable, Viable, Feasible</h3>
							<p>The results of our research allowed us to finalize the vision of how ReelHire would operate. Once we had a clear idea in place, our next step was to create various user stories to start estimating the required functionality. All team members were taking part in this process, giving their own perspectives and voicing ideas of how different features would work or could be implemented. During these discussions we tried to be efficient, keeping in mind the budget and the affordable scope, trying to eliminate feature creep and focusing only on essential functionality we thought would be valuable for our users. We used simple drawings to prototype how different features might look and work and tried to go through as many ideas as we could. Several times we ran those feature lists by our friends in HR, getting their feedback and adjusting accordingly.</p>
							
							<hr>

							<h3>Documenting key definitions</h3>
							<p>At some point during the planning stage we found that it became increasingly hard to communicate ideas without a proper documented set of terms. So once the key concepts of the service were identified, we settled on their naming and documented their explanation and functionality, so it would be easy to discuss and stay on the same page during the development process.</p>

							<p>For example:</p>
							<p>Questionnaire - an object consisting of position description, company description and 4 questions for a candidate to answer.</p>
							<p>Questionnaire Folder - an object with a list of applicants who have completed the questionnaire this folder represents and submitted it.</p>

							<div class="quote">
								<h2 style="text-align: center;">“Documenting key definitions allowed to drastically improve communication and ideation”</h2>
							</div>
							
							<p>By doing just that we were able to drastically improve the ideation and brainstorming processes, while also making communication inside the team easier and more to the point, saving ourselves an incredible amount of time. It helped us to focus on discussing new ideas rather then argue over the same ones in different words.</p>

							<hr>

							<h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>
							<p>We tried to validate all of our major interface and system design decisions through fast prototypes and rapid field testings. Since all the team members were situated in different countries, each one of us performed his/her own tests and later shared the results with the rest of the team. We would use rough mockups on mobile or tablet, since they were cheap, quick to iterate on and were decent enough to immerse ourselves in a scenario and take notice of different aspects of the experience we were having at the moment. In addition, we sometimes used role-play during the on-line meetings to try and simulate a recruiter-candidate interaction before and after using our service and how those might change.</p>

							<div class="quote">
								<h2 style="text-align: center;">“Rough mockups were cheap, quick to iterate on and good enough to let us walk in users’ shoes”</h2>
							</div>

							<p>To create field tests, we first of all brainstormed all the circumstances we could think of under which our future users might be using our service. Some of our scenarios incorporated situations, when both recruiters and job seekers where using the mobile version of the service while being in public transport or in the street, at lunch in the park or cafe. So we went to all those places, putting ourselves in those situations and tried to imagine and figure out how constraints and various perception and physical limitations in those places might influence the goals and needs of our future users.</p>

							</div>
							
							<div class="quote">
								<h2 style="text-align: center;">“We lived through dozens of scenarios, analyzing users’ possible needs, goals and constraints”</h2>
							</div>
							
							<p>Secondly, we explored situations like: a recruiter receiving and checking a questionnaire response at home or a recruiter creating and sending out a questionnaire to a candidate while on their way to work. This raised a lot of synchronization questions we did not think of before. Also, we've tried to understand, if it was comfortable to watch a video answer while on public transit, and if yes, how would a recruiter mark his or her impression about a candidate, or make a note to re-watch the video answer later during the day, or, if it was reasonable, to add a quick feedback button to each video answer.</p>

							</div>

							<div class="quote">
								<h2 style="text-align: center;">“Each feature that proved valuable enough made its way into the service architecture”</h2>
							</div>

							<p>In addition, for job seekers we explored situations like receiving questionnaire notifications while on the bus, submitting questionnaires with predefined videos, starting a process of filling in a questionnaire while finishing it later. We explored the possibility of recording videos on mobile, uploading video from mobile, synchronization between desktop and mobile and co-existence of the same account across several devices. We took into consideration the possible limitations of mobile internet, and planned to allow the ability to disable features that use a lot of bandwidth. One of our main goals during this process was also to understand the context of each situation and the amount of complexity we were able to afford.</p>

							<hr>

							<h3>Research established recruiting process</h3>
							<p>Our first step was internet research. We browsed through articles about recruiting and its best practises, old and new ways. Also, since all of us had some personal experience looking for jobs, interacting with recruiters and going through interviews, we shared those experiences with each other, partially building our assumptions upon them. </p>
							
							<div class="quote">
								<h2 style="text-align: center;">“In order to start bringing value instantly our service needed to seamlessly integrate into an already established process”</h2>
							</div>

							<p>Once we were more or less acquainted with the process we turned to recruiters and HR specialists, interviewing them, analyzing their processes and how they worked with candidates. Particularly, we focused on the methods and practices they used to gather information about candidates before passing them to a client or a team. After analyzing the collected data, we mapped a unified process of how a recruiter works with a potential candidate. This was the process we decided to go with:</p>

							<img class="img-responsive" src="images/rh-1-2.jpg">

							<p>After analyzing the above-mentioned process, we felt that screening interviews were a promising area for us and decided to study them in more detail. Our main goal was to figure out what part of this process could we enhance with videos.</p>

							<img class="img-responsive" src="images/rh-1-3.jpg">

							<p>Screening interviews are generally meant to check two things about a candidate: Qualifications and Personality</p>

							<h4>Qualifications Check</h4>
							<p>Qualifications check is done in various ways, most commonly through reviewing a candidate's text resume, his or her references and LinkedIn profile. We felt this area was already overcrowded with quality alternatives to present your job experience and skills. Plus, our service was meant to be about videos and we didn't see how videos would help people convey their qualifications more efficiently, except for couple of specific professions that we were not targeting to cover.</p>

							<h4>Personality Check</h4>
							</p>Personality check, however, can be done either through screening calls or through online psychological tests. Only a small number of recruiters we interviewed told us they were using personality tests, leaving screening calls to be the single most popular way to evaluate a candidate's personality.</p>

							<hr>

							<h3>Screening call process analysis</h3>
							<p>The process of a screening call is fairly simple: a recruiter contacts a potential candidate via email and offers to schedule a 30 min call via phone or skype. Then, a recruiter calls the candidate at a previously agreed time and asks a couple of standard questions to evaluate candidate’s personality and confirm previous experience.</p>

							<div class="quote">
								<h2 style="text-align: center;">“Based on the results, we assumed screening interviews could benefit from using videos”</h2>
							</div>

							<p>After researching on the internet and questioning our consultants on the topic in more details, we got a decent enough understanding of the screening call process to start brainstorming on how we could possibly enhance it.</p>

							<hr>

							<h3>Identifying flaws</h3>
							<p>First we started by brainstorming on the flaws of the screening calls. We felt there were a lot of repetitive meaningless actions involved that could be eliminated using the benefits of video, sound and automatization. The key flaws we ended up were the following</p>

							<div class="quote">
								<h2 style="text-align: center;">“Screening calls are repetitive and take a lot of time to schedule and conduct”</h2>
							</div>

							<p>First of all it takes a lot of time to schedule and conduct screening calls due to a fairly large number of people, who are potentially qualified for the job. Also, there is always some time required to spend on preparations before talking to each candidate. A recruiter can spend up to an hour per single candidate, even though a call itself takes an average of 25 minutes.</p>

							<p>Secondly, during screening calls, recruiters tend to ask candidates the same standard questions. This process is repetitive, tiring and inefficient. And repetitiveness is the one thing computers and automated systems deal with the best.</p>

							<hr>

							<h3>Brainstorming enhancements</h3>
							<p>After that we tried to imagine a flow that would eliminate repetitiveness and the need for scheduling. We used a service-on-demand philosophy and made use of the benefits provided by sound and video recording. We wanted something that would work automatically, without recruiter being involved in the process of getting information from a candidate.</p>

							<div class="quote">
								<h2 style="text-align: center;">“We tried to imagine a different flow - automated, versatile and on-demand”</h2>
							</div>

							<p>Our main goals for the new system and process were: automated, versatile, schedule free and repetitiveness free. We started introducing different ideas and adjustments, using an extremely lean and agile process, going back and forth with recruiters, refining our ideas based on their feedback. We also developed a couple of standard scenarios to test our new ideas against. Finally, we mapped out a process all parties agreed to be potentially promising, easily integratabtle and such, that would bring value instantly.</p>
							
							<hr>

							<h3>Result</h3>
							
							<img class="img-responsive" src="images/rh-1-4.png">

							<h4>New Process Description</h4>
							</p>When a recruiter is done checking a candidate's resume and feels that a candidate is qualified for a position, she enters her ReelHire profile and creates a questionnaire consisting of up to 4 questions. Then the recruiter sends a link of that questionnaire to a candidate. A candidate clicks the link, and is transferred to the ReelHire service, were he records 30 seconds video answers to the recruiter's questions at his own pace, with a certain deadline. Once the candidate is done recording the answers, he submits them back to the recruiter. Recruiter receives a notification, that the answers are available to watch and can watch them anywhere, anytime.</p>

							<img class="img-responsive" src="images/rh-1-5.jpg">

							<h4>Improvement</h4>
							</p>The new process was estimated to potentially decrease the time a recruiter would spend evaluating a candidates personality by 90% compared to the time required to conduct a screening call. For example: Instead of ~40-50 minutes per person a recruiter would now spend around 7 minutes, including the time to open the app and navigate to a candidate's video answer.</p>

								<h2 style="text-align: center;">“New process was estimated to decrease the time a recruiter would spend to evaluate a candidates personality by 90%”</h2>
							</div>

							<h4>Additional benefits</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Eliminated the need for scheduling calls, since a candidate was free to record video answers any time  - recruiter could video answers whenever it was convenient</li>
								<li>Same questionnaire could be sent to multiple candidates instantly</li>
								<li>Ability to duplicate and re-use old questionnaires for new positions</li>
